# Steam Palettes

This is the successor to [steamy-screenshots](https://github.com/cheshire137/steamy-screenshots), built as a React web app.

## How to Run

    cp src/env.sh.example src/env.sh

Get a [Steam Web API key](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and add it to src/env.sh.

    brew install cairo
    npm install
    npm start

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view the app. The server runs on port 5000.
